   Hanjara CA (mashanz) | Full Stack Developer
==================================================

My first experience doing programming is when I 
was at Elementary School (2006). I build calculator 
and some games. Visual basic is my first language 
and now I love doing in python. I have interest 
with wide variety of technology like IoT, Software 
Development and Embedded System.

In 2011 I build my first web application, my own 
CMS and High School Club Online Registration using 
pure PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery 
Framework using XAMPP stack. 

3 Years after I switch to C++ and Python to build 
robots. Humanoid Robot Soccer is the most 
challenging Development in my Undergrad times. We 
have less than 3 month to build Humanoid Robot 
that able to play soccer from scratch. Coding the 
Movements, Coordination, Visual Recognition, Sensor 
and integrated all system to work simultaneously 
is not easy but we manage it. 

Recently, I focusing to Software Development 
because the cost of development for Software is 
cheaper rather than IoT or Robotics. I can undo/revert 
the code if there some bugs, but I am unable to 
undo/revert mainboard if its burned.
