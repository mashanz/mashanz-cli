[Hanjara CA] Mashanz | The Noob Software Engineer
==================================================

My first experience doing programming is when I 
was at Elementary School (2006). I build 
calculator and some games. Visual basic is my 
first language and now I love doing in python. 
Even I have more than 15 years of experience of 
programming I still googling the basic syntax when
I "forgot" about it and re learn.
